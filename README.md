# TradingLogic.jl

An attempt at a unified framework in the Julia language for both event-driven backtesting and live trading. This package utilizes reactive programming elements implemented in [Reactive.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl).

The main objective is to be able to backtest and place real-time orders using the same trading strategy functions.
